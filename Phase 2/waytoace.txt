Now the actual Phase 2 blueprint (write this somewhere)
Phase 2 Goal (non-negotiable)

Be comfortable with Div 3 A–B and Div 4 C, sometimes touching Div 3 C without crying.

Rating Range You Should Hunt

900 – 1200 on Codeforces

Sweet spot: 1000–1100

Below 900 = too trivial

Above 1200 = ego trap, avoid for now




Phase 2 Topics & Tools (in the right order)
1. Sorting as a weapon

You already know how to sort. You don’t know why to sort.

Tools:

sort()

Sorting pairs

Sorting to make patterns visible

Problems look like:

“Make array beautiful”

“Minimize / maximize something”

“Rearrange elements”

2. Frequency counting (Hashing lite)

Because checking everything twice is stupid.

Tools:

map, unordered_map

Frequency arrays

Counting occurrences

Used when:

Repetitions matter

You see words like “how many”, “frequency”, “distinct”

3. Prefix sums

This is where your nested loops die.

Tools:

Prefix sum array

Range sum queries

Difference of prefix sums

Used when:

Many subarray queries

Repeated sum calculations

4. Two pointers

For people who are tired of O(n²).

Tools:

Left and right pointers

Sliding window

Shrinking and expanding ranges

Used when:

Array/string is sorted

You need pairs, ranges, or windows

5. Greedy thinking (basic)

Not “greedy is always right”, but when it is right.

Tools:

Local optimal choices

Sorting + taking smallest/largest first

Used when:

You’re asked to minimize or maximize something step by step

6. Basic math observations

Not formulas. Just common sense math.

Tools:

Modulo

Parity (odd/even)

GCD basics

Digits

Used when:

Constraints are large

Direct simulation looks slow




How you should “learn” each topic (important)

For each topic:

Read 10–15 minutes of explanation (not a 2-hour lecture)

Solve 2 easy problems

Then immediately hunt 2–3 problems in the 1000–1100 range

If you do theory first for everything, you fail Phase 2 without even starting it.
